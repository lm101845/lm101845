<img height="25" src='https://qpluspicture.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/6LjjQA/Hi.gif' alt='Hi' width="24"/> Hi, I'm Li Ming,I was Born in 1994, bachelor degree, major in finance, graduated in 2017, and did finance and audit work for 4 years after graduation.

In August 2018, I had the idea of changing careers. During the period, I watched video courses such as C language, Java, computer network, etc. , But in the end did not insist on learning. 

It was not until August 2019 that I decided to take the front-end as my career development direction. From then on, I started my self-study career while going to work for one and a half years.

On February 23, 2021, I resigned from the financial position and switched to another job, and finally found a front-end job. From March 16 to April 30, 2021, I resigned for some reason. This is my first front-end job. , It lasts 45 days.

I am currently studying at home. I am ready to do more projects and consolidate the knowledge points I have learned before, and prepare for the next interview and job hunting. :)
